        <p>
            Welcome to Retro Fighters Arcade! We are a group of passionate students on a mission to bring back the magic
            of classic gaming.
            Our goal is to design and build a fully functional retro arcade machine from scratch, using components that
            we are readily available to us.

            Our team is dedicated to creating an authentic arcade experience while learning valuable skills in hardware
            and software design.
            From designing the cabinet to wiring the controls, we're excited to share our journey and bring our love for
            retro gaming to life!
